        <p>Hi! It seems you're curious about my pronouns :)</p>
        <p>
          I can't exactly tell if you're a bigot or are genuinely curious about my pronouns, so if you're a bigot (only 2 genders, etc) just skip 
          <a href="/secret/they/bigots/">over here</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="nm">now that that's out of the way...</h2>
      <div class="big-para">
        <p>If you didn't know, they/them pronouns basically means instead of using "he" or "she" to refer to me, you should use they.</p><br>
        <p>Examples being:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>They</b> went to the store.</li>
          <li>I went with <b>them</b> to the store.</li>
          <li>I think that it was <b>their</b> idea.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and so on.</p><br>
        <p>Also, as for terms like "dude" and other things like that, I'm fine with both masculine and feminine terms as I write this.</p>
        <p>That's about it, thanks for stopping by! <3</p><br>
